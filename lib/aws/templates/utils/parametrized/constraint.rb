        # Constraint functor class
        #
        # A constraint is a Proc which accepts one parameter which is a value
        # which needs to be checked and ir is expected to throw an exception
        # if the value is not in compliance with the constraint
        #
        # The class implements functor pattern through to_proc method and
        # closure. Essentially, all constraints can be used everywhere where
        # a block is expected.
        #
        # It provides protected method check which should be overriden in
        # all concrete constraint classes.

          # of Parametrized instance which provides proper set "self" variable.
