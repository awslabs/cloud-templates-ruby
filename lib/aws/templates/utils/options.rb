      # Implements the core mechanism of hash lookup, merge, and transformation.
      #
      # It supports nested hash lookup with index function and wildcard
      # hash definitions on any level of nested hierarchy so you can define
      # fallback values right in the input hash. The algorithm will try to
      # select the best combination if it doesn't see the exact match
      # during lookup.

        # non-hash value somewhere in the middle. Also, the method
