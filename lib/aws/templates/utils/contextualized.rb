      # hierarchy when invoked. The target mixing entity should be either
      # Module or Class. In the former case it's possible to model set of
      # object which have common traits organized as an arbitrary graph
      # with many-to-many relationship.

      # Important difference from defaults is that the final result returned
      # by "filter" mixed method is a functor. No operations are performed
      # on options.
