    # Basic artifact
    #
    # "Artifact" in the terminology of the framework is an entity which
    # can represent any parametrizable object type from any problem domain
    # possible. For instance, for CloudFormation, artifacts are resources
    # in a CFN template, the template itself
    #
    # If your target domain is infrastructure orchestration, artifact is
    # usually a single entity such as S3 volume, ASG, DynamoDB table, etc.
    # However, the notion of artifact is not particularly fixed since the
    # framework can be used for different purposes including documents
    # generation and general templating tasks. Basically, artifact is a
    # single parametrizable entity or a step in input hash
    # transformations.
    #
    # Artifact classes work together with meta-programming mechanisms in
    # Ruby language enabling artifacts inheritance in the natural way
    # using simple Ruby classes. The feature is useful when you have a
    # group of artifacts which share the same basic parameters but differ
    # in details.
    #
    # The central part in the framework is played by processed hash. All
    # mechanisms are based on simple ad-hoc merging rules which are
    # described at merge method but basis can be described as following:
    # each superclass initializer accepts children class processed hash
    # as input hash and the hash is processed recursively through
    # class hierarchy. Old values are newer removed by default so the
    # whole process is no more than continuous hash expansion.
    #
    #    class Piece < Artifact
    #      default { { output: options[:param] } }
    #    end
    #
    #    class ConcretePiece < Piece
    #      default param: 'Came from child'
    #    end
    #
    #    Piece.new(a: 1, b: 2).options.to_hash # => { a: 1, b: 2, output: nil }
    #    ConcretePiece.new(a: 1, b: 2).options.to_hash
    #    # => { a: 1, b: 2, output: 'Came from child', param: 'Came from child' }
    #
    # Also, as one of the peculiarities of the framework, you can override
    # any auto-generated parameter with input hash if they have the same
    # name/path.
